1. Project Overview
Fish Evolution Adventure is a 2D interactive educational game built using OpenGL and GLUT. It
presents a dynamic ocean environment where players control a fish that evolves by consuming
smaller fish while avoiding larger or hostile species. The game combines mathematical
animations, real-time physics, collision detection, and object-oriented design.
2. General Description of the Project
The project simulates a realistic underwater world with animated waves, diverse fish species,
and smooth player controls. The player's journey begins as a small fish with the primary
objective of surviving, growing, and adapting. The game introduces a progression system where
the player grows in size upon consuming smaller fish, unlocking the ability to eat larger species
that were previously dangerous.
What makes this project unique is its balance between entertainment and educational value. It
provides a fun gameplay experience while teaching essential computer graphics concepts such
as transformations, collision physics, and rendering pipelines.
3. Educational Objectives
This project covers several major areas of computer graphics and game development:
• Mastering transformation matrices - scaling, rotation, and translation applied to fish
models.
• Understanding 2D rendering with OpenGL - drawing complex shapes using polygons and
parametric curves.
• Implementing physics & collision detection - using circular hitboxes and vector distance
calculations.
• Constructing a real-time game loop - timers, frame updates, and event-driven input.
• Building object-oriented systems - reusable classes for fish, behavior patterns, and
movement.
The project strengthens the student’s understanding of mathematical concepts applied in
graphics, such as trigonometric wave functions, distance formulas, and spatial transformations.
4. System Features
• Dynamic animated ocean using sine wave simulation.
• Multiple fish types: small, medium, large, and hostile red fish.
• Growth system that scales the player model based on consumed fish.
2• Collision-based interactions with realistic consequences.
• Smooth mouse-based movement and responsive controls.
• Sound effects for scoring, danger, and game-over states.
• Win conditions and loss conditions handled through clear UI screens.
5. Technologies & Libraries Used
• C++ programming language
• OpenGL (Graphics Rendering)
• GLUT (Window, input, and event handling)
• Windows API – Beep sound system
• Standard Libraries: <cmath>, <vector>, <ctime>, <cstdlib>, <cstring>
6. Architecture & File Structure
The project is organized into clear folders ensuring readability and scalability:
• main.cpp → Main game logic, rendering system, physics, and object handling.
• assets/ → Sound files, textures (if added later).
• docs/ → All documentation files including this one.
• build/ → Compiled game executable.
• shaders/ → (Optional) shader programs for advanced rendering.
• README.md → Quick overview of how to run and compile the game.
7. Detailed System Explanation
This section breaks down the internal components of the game:
7.1 Ocean Rendering
The ocean is drawn using gradient-filled backgrounds and animated sine-wave polygons. Each
frame updates the vertical wave offset to simulate natural water motion.
37.2 Fish Rendering System
Fish are rendered using polygon-based shapes approximating ellipses and fins created with
triangle fans. Each fish type has a color code and size multiplier. The rendering process applies
translation and directional transformations depending on movement direction.
7.3 Movement & Behavior
Non-player fish follow linear horizontal movement with randomized speed and respawn
positions. The player fish moves with mouse coordinates, inverted vertically to match OpenGL's
coordinate system.
7.4 Collision Detection
Collisions use distance formulas: if the squared distance between two fish centers is less than
the square of their combined collision radii, an interaction occurs. Based on the fish type, the
player either gains points, grows in size, or loses the game.
7.5 Sound and UI System
Sound cues are triggered using Windows API beeps. The user interface includes score, timer,
win/loss screens, and restart instructions displayed via bitmap fonts.
8. Conclusion
Fish Evolution Adventure is a complete, educational, and enjoyable graphics project that
demonstrates the ability to combine mathematics, rendering, physics, and game design into one
cohesive system. The project highlights strong fundamentals and modular programming skills.
